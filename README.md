# Conqueror of Empires
Conqueror of Empires is a turn-based strategy game where up to 4 local players battle to be victorious, by expanding their empires, and controlling units to conquer cities and attack the enemy.

The game was inspired by [Polytopia](http://midjiwan.com/polytopia.html) and [Civilisation](https://civilization.com/) and made using python and pygame.
